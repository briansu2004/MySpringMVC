# What maven and gradle files should not be checked in

## What files should not be checked in for maven projects?

In a Maven project, you typically should not check in the following files and folders into your code repository:

1. `.mvn` folder: This folder contains project-specific configuration files for the Maven build process. It is usually tailored to your local environment and is not meant to be shared among different developers. Include only your `pom.xml` in the repository, as it specifies the project's dependencies and build settings.

2. `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`: These are Maven Wrapper scripts similar to the Gradle Wrapper scripts (`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`). They allow you to run Maven commands without requiring a globally installed Maven version.

The purpose of these wrapper scripts is to ensure that everyone working on the project uses the same version of Maven. By not checking them into the repository, you encourage developers to generate these scripts locally using the `mvn wrapper:wrapper` command. This way, each developer can have the appropriate version of Maven for the project.

In summary, do not check in the `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files into your code repository. Encourage developers to use the Maven Wrapper by generating the scripts locally.

1. `.settings` folder: This folder often contains Eclipse IDE-specific settings and preferences. Since it's IDE-specific and can vary between developers, it's better not to include it in your repository.

By excluding these files and folders, you keep your code repository cleaner and focus on the essential project source code and build configuration. Developers can configure their own local environments as needed and generate any necessary project-specific files.

## What files should not be checked in for gradle projects?

In a Gradle project, you generally should not check in the following files and folders into your code repository:

1. `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`: These are Gradle wrapper scripts that allow developers to run Gradle tasks without having Gradle installed globally on their systems. Instead of checking them in, you can generate them locally using the `gradle wrapper` task. Including these scripts in the repository is not necessary, and it allows developers to use the specified Gradle version for the project.

2. `settings.gradle`: This file is specific to project settings and the inclusion of subprojects in a multi-project build. It can vary depending on the project structure and dependencies, so it's better not to check it into the repository.

3. IDE-specific files: Files and folders related to specific Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) should not be included. These often include `.idea` for IntelliJ IDEA, `.project`, `.classpath`, and `.settings` for Eclipse, or `.vscode` for Visual Studio Code. These files are typically generated by the IDE and are not meant to be shared among developers.

By excluding these files and folders, you keep your code repository cleaner and more focused on the essential project source code and build configuration within the `build.gradle` files. Developers can generate any necessary project-specific files or use the provided Gradle wrapper for consistency across different environments.
